<p> You will spawn with rocks and trees randomly generated with different locations, a ball will appear visible and there will be a hidden platform as well as rocks and trees changing positions when you change planes. When you shift planes depending on what's visible the ball will be visible or the platform will be. You will have to memorize where the ball is and where the platform is then navigate the ball through the obsticles and put it ontop of the platform.</p>
